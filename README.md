# Python Projects
This repository contains a collection of Python projects I have worked on.  
The focus is on practical applications of Python in areas such as:

- **Web Scraping** → Extracting product prices and information from websites  
- **Data Analysis** → Cleaning, exploring, and visualizing datasets  
- **Automation Scripts** → Simple tools to make repetitive tasks easier  
- **Experimentation** → Trying out Python libraries and new concepts  

## Tools & Libraries
- `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium` → for scraping  
- `Pandas`, `NumPy` → for analysis  
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` → for visualization  

## Goal
The purpose of this repo is to practice and showcase my Python skills, while building projects that solve real-world problems.
